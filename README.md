About me
-
---
I am always filled with funky ideas. 
Keep questioning and asking for improvement. 
Obsessed with code maintainability but poor with giving a good variable name. 
I love the refactoring process, but it feels painful when designing the new structure. 
Shy when first get in touch, but suddenly become a bad joke machine when familiarised.
